# What is Serverless

For ages the frontend and backend of sites have been hosted on individual
servers. Serverless allows you to execute application logic without visible
processes, servers, virtual machines, or operation systems.

Serverless allows developers to focus purely on the code and let the
Iaas(Infrastructure as a service) handle the deployment and execution in
production. This has numerous benefits of which we will go over in this post.

# The Hype Behind Serverless

The Serverless market is expected to reach around 18.04 billion globally This
incites massive growth in this market is expected by many, but what is
Serverless? What has millions of developers switching to Serverless?

# How It Works

The most popular Serverless service is Amazon Web Service's AWS Lambda works by
using functions. Functions are the core of Serverless. You can upload your code
and then set a trigger that can set off and run that code. This has been done
before so what makes Serverless so great? Serverless is pure compute power. This
makes it infinitely easier to scale as you don't have to manage containers and
kubernetes clusters along with many other major benefits.

The primary use cases of Serverless is web deployment and ML but has benefits
everywhere. You can set a function to run when a URL request is triggered.

# The Pros of Serverless

The main pros for Serverless are

-   Lower Costs
-   Infinitely easier to scale
-   Better uptime
-   Easier to deploy
-   Faster Development
-   Faster Respond time
-   More Flexibility
-   More Efficient

Serverless removes developers working on managing servers in the cloud using
services like docker and kubernetes. Since the code is no longer on servers you
can scale infinitely easier and faster. No more times when a developer will be
called in the night with the message "The server is down" and be forced to run
back into and identify the problem in the night. With Serverless you have
virtually no infrastructure to maintain, just watch the requests and watch it
scale infinitely. Serverless also has 0 costs when its not running and is
cheaper when its just compute power. For each request the cloud spins up a new
service running the code on request.

# The Cons of Serverless

The primary cons of Serverless architecture.

-   Vendor Lock In
-   Debugging
-   Local Testing
-   Migration
-   Legacy Code and Infrastructure

Serverless functions are triggered by actions that will often require a
development solution inside the written code. This makes it harder to switch
between services and lock you into the service you have chosen. This can make
things difficult when you have better options for services in the long run.

Debugging in production is often difficult in a Serverless architecture. Not
having terminal access and having is spin up a new function on every trigger
makes it hard to track these processes. Testing locally can also be more
difficult when your code is configured to trigger on functions.

Legacy code is still common and running legacy code on cloud functions not
adapted to the service is extremely difficult. Most services and projects were
built to run programs on servers and so Serverless architecture has been adapted
to fit with servers on its best. Serverless functions cannot correctly return
status properly codes over http as http was built in mind with servers and
programming in general adapted those standards. Migration to Serverless can be
difficult.

# Summary

Serverless architecture has massive potential and I look forward to the
Serverless future. While Serverless solves many major problems it brings up some
problems of its own. Serverless can be adapted to meet many needs but you should
still consider servers and how you would benefit.
