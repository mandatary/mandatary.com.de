# What is Concurrency?

Concurrency is when code is running in parallel or alongside a parent program
using another CPU core. Concurrency allows to break up a program to be executed
out-of-order at the same time.

# What is Concurrency used for?

Concurrency is used such as separating an API call to the server this allows for
the server to still accept requests and handle multiple at the same time.
Concurrency can also be used for simultaneous processes to run at the same time
or splitting up CPU intensive work.

# Concurrency in Golang

## Goroutines

A goroutine is a concurrent process in Golang running separate to the main
thread. Lets start with a simple concurrent program.

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "time"
)

func main() {
 count("task 1")
 count("task 2")
}

func count(thing string) {
 for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(thing)
        time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
    }
}
```

In this program we have 2 tasks both running in the main function. They both
will print their text every two seconds 5 times. But in this program there is no
concurrency so the first task will execute first then the second. If we make the
first task a goroutine it will run in parallel. We add the "go" in front of the
function to run it concurrently.

Golang handles the process of interacting with the CPU to run it separately
which gives us the easy job.

```go
func main() {
 go count("task 1")
 count("task 2")
}
```

The two tasks now run in parallel and the program exits when they are finished.
If we were to run both functions concurrently they would exit immediately
because the main thread finished.

# Conclusion

Concurrency is great and has many uses but keep in mind just adding hundreds of
go routines isn't going to make your program run faster as it is ultimately
determined by the CPU.
