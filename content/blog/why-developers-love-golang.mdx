# What is Golang?

Golang(Go) is a programming language developed by Google in 2009. Since then
Golang has made its way up to the top 10 most loved programming languages and
the 2nd most paid programming language.

When I first learned Go I didn't expect it to be a hit. I thought it was just a
faster Java or an alternative to Node.js. Even then it had a robust community
but here are the reasons I and so many other developers love Go.

## Golang Environment

The Golang environment is different than any other language. Its structured so
that all Golang projects are in one folder. This folder is set as an environment
variable as `$GOPATH`. The Golang environment is structured by 3 folders, bin,
pkg, and src. The bin folder stores Golang Binary files such as the mux.exe
router. It saves the builds and other scripts in here but its not something you
need to touch. Pkg is where Golang stores the complier and other scripts it
uses. In the final and main folder src, is where you put your projects. All
packages downloaded and used are stored in src as well as where you can put your
projects. All Imports in Golang are relative to `$GOPATH\src` which makes things
very consistent and easy to change files to your need. Overall the Golang
enviroment is something I much prefer over packages.json and or Pipfiles.

## The Command Line

Golang commands are made simple. Want to get a package? <br />
`go get -u github.com/package/package` <br /> Want to run your code? <br />
`go run ./file.go`<br /> Want to compile your code? <br />
`go build ./file.go`<br /> Want to fetch the dependencies of a file <br />
`go install ./file.go`<br />

Overall the consistency and ease of use in the command line makes things easier
and you can focus on other parts of the development process.

## Modules and Tests

The way Golang handles tests without any external libraries makes it very easy
to create tests. Just end a file with \_test.go and then you can run go test to
start the unit test. All modules in Golang are easy to access with the file
structure and since Golang has no built in modular place you can use GitHub or
anything other place you see fit to use Golang modules or packages.

## Consistency in Golang

Golang offers a clear and concise way to write code. It has a built in
formatter, fmt, that keeps strict standards in go. Unlike languages like
JavaScript or Python Golang usually has a simple way to do things and structure
code. This leads to overall cleaner code bases and prevents junior developers
from writing unclean code because in Golang you have to write clean code. The
compiler will not compile if a variable is not used. Golang has no exceptions
which requires you to write code in a safe and clean way.

Golang is also typed which means you get better intellisense and catch errors
before runtime. Golang doesn't support classes, operators, function overloading,
optional parameters, or exceptions, requiring developers to write code in a
clear and concise way. Golang isn't a functional language and it isn't an object
oriented one either. It takes the best of both worlds and throws out the things
that are bad to form an amazing language.

## Concurrency and Speed

Save the best for last. Golang was built for concurrency in mind. You don't have
to import something to do this it is built in. You can just use go.

```go
go func() {
    fmt.Println("This is a simultaneous process")
}
```

This core concept allows developers to use things like channels and things you
won't see in other languages to better utilize this concept. Recently this

<a href="https://medium.com/smsjunk/handling-1-million-requests-per-minute-with-golang-f70ac505fcaa">article</a> talks about how they were able to utilize 1 million requests per minute with
Golang, more than any other language has seen with the exception of c++

Now did I mention Golang is fast? Crazy fast. Golang framework gofiber ran a
speed test against similar framework Express(JavaScript Framework) and Golang
was able to consistently handle requests on average 2.0 ms while Express had an
average of 354 latency. Golang was able to handle 6,162,556 requests while
Express could only handle 367,069 requests. That's 17x more requests compared to
the most in use node framework today. You can learn more about this experiment
with gofiber <a href="https://docs.gofiber.io/extra/benchmarks">here</a>. Golang
compile time is also crazy fast which is why developers will run tests on every
compile because they don't take long at all.

## Golang's built in Libraries

Golang's built in library support is incredible and means you won't have to
import excess modules like in Node. You can run a local server in just a few
lines out of the box with net/http built in package. You are able to lookup a
sites Nameservers, mx records, and CNAME with a built-in function. Typically
when you build large projects you will only ever use one or two external
packages which also dedicates to the speed and ease of use of Golang.

Golang is a major language and an amazing skill to add to your skillset. Its
ease of use and speed are unrivaled and I believe you should learn Golang as a
language.
