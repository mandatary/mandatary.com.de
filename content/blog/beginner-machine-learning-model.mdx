## Prerequisites:

-   Basic Understanding of Python

## Make sure you have the following installed on your device

-   Python (the programming language)
-   Tensorflow
-   Mathplotlib(optional)
-   Numpy(optional)

## What will our Model do?

The model we will be constructing is one of the most basic models and we will be
using it to predict the y coordinate of a line

## First we will start with out imports

```py
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Next Lets define our data

Our training Data - the data our model will train on

```py
x_points = np.array([3, 5, 7, 9])

y_points = np.array([6, 10, 14, 18])
```

Our Test Data - this is the x axis we will be predicting

```py
test_x = np.array([2, 4, 7, 20])
```

## Building our Model

First we have to define our model - for this blog we will be using a premade
model for simplicity

```py
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])
```

## Compiling our Model

Next we need to build our model

Optimizer is build in so we don't need to worry about that

	here
</a>

```py
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

## Training the Model

We want to train out model on the training data so it can predict on the test
data

Epochs is how many times the model trains on our data. Typically this varies for
the dataset but in this case we are using 100

model.fit(x_points, y_points, epochs=100)

Testing the Model

We now have our model built now we need to test it

This is predicting on the test X data we defined earlier

```py
test_y = model.predict(test_x)
```

Plotting Our Data

Now that we have our predicted model we can plot our data using mathplotlib

```py
plt.plot(x_points, y_points, label='Train Data')
plt.plot(test_x, test_y, label='Test Data')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This Graph will Show

<img src="/blog/ml.webp" alt="ML Graph" />

```py
Train Data:
x [3, 5, 7, 9]
y [6, 10, 14, 18]

Test Data
x [2, 4, 7, 20]

Model Predicted
y [ 4.0757785, 8.044292, 13.997064, 39.792404 ]

Actual
y [4, 8, 14, 40]
```

It is important to note that machine learning does not typically have exact
answers. It deals in probability and as you can see it is very close to the
actual data
