## Motivation

I recently attended Google's I/O event and tuned in to the Machine Learning
Keynote. I thought this blog would fit the timing as well

5 years ago tensorflow was open sourced by google and it has grown tremendously
in production environments. Here are some of the recent advancements in
Tensorflow and the Machine Learning/AI field.

## Tensorflow Hub

Thousands of pretrained Machine Learning models to be open sourced and used by
the community. Run Models in the browser or on the cloud and upload images
directly on the site to test the model.

## Vertex AI

A managed ML platform to deploy an AI in a production environment. Improving
MLOps end to end. Speeding up development, training, and deploying along with
continuous monitoring and training in production environments.

## KnowYourData

Know your data is designed to help researchers and engineers understand datasets
and improve data quality. It contains 70+ large ML datasets to use along with
real-time filtering and grouping data. Easily compare what makes a good dataset
as well as a bad dataset by finding bias and correlation.

## Tensorflow Cloud

Works as a pip package to easily run your models in the cloud. Just add
tfc.run() in your model and it will run. This can be useful when working with
large datasets where you can specify the GPUs and computing power you want in
the code.

## ML Kit

Launching 4 new Vision APIs for a total of 12 APIs to supply developers with
easy to use APIs such as face detection, language identification, image
labeling, text recognition, and more.

Attending Google I/O was a unique experience in which I was able to learn new
skills, meet new people and learn where to continue my learning. I look forward
to attending other Developer Events and continue learning.
